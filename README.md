Unity project that purpose is to connect with Resonite
using ResoniteLink


Supports : 
  - Simple slot inspector to change values in components like: bools, strings, float3,int and float
  - Able to use unity inspector to modify rotation and position scale. You can move multiple objects at the same time

You can for example change lighting power or position.

Limitations:
  - No actuall render so no mesh visible only empty gameobjects, becouse resonite link does not give me ANY MESH or TEXTURE data i cannot display them.
  - Currently i cannot as I make it to work correctly to add components, i cannot make a list cuz i cant get AllComponentList in resonitelink
  - Moving Parent in unity inspector does not give it.

Broken Things (Todo fix):
  - Sometimes the Gameobject Active is settings itself to False ??
  - RedoWorld Its kinda broken it does not sync Unity with resolink. AFTER being connected and added something like new object thru resonite.. It does not show up
  - ENUMS DOES NOT WORK 😭!!!

Todo : 
  - Able to import from unity to reso
  - Able to see world meshes from resonite -> Unity. (When possible 😢)
