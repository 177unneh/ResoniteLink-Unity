Unity project that purpose is to connect with Resonite
using ResoniteLink


Supports : 
  - Simple slot inspector to change values in components like: bools, strings, float3,int and float
  - Able to use unity inspector to modify rotation and position scale. You can move multiple objects at the same time

You can for example change lighting power or position.

Limitations:
  - No actuall render, becouse resonite link does not give me ANY MESH or TEXTURE data i cannot display them.
  - Currently i cannot as I make it to work correctly to add components, i cannot make a list cuz i cant get AllComponentList in resonitelink
  - Moving Parent in unity inspector does not give it.
  - RedoWorld Its kinda broken it does not sync Unity with resolink.
  - ENUMS DOES NOT WORK 😭!!!
